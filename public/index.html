    The first program I ever saw being written
    was a simple addition function running on a Commodore 64, and believe me, I didn’t even know what I was looking at.
    The year was <code>1989</code> and I was 9 years old. To fill the gap in this memory, I asked <span
    class="gpt">GPT</span>, and...
  </p>
  <div class="gpt">
    <div class="gpt_column_left">
      <blockquote class="gpt">
        Back in 1989 on a Commodore 64, the most common programming language was
        <strong>Commodore BASIC 2.0</strong>, which came built into the machine.
        If someone wrote a simple addition function, it was probably in BASIC,
        looking something like this:
      </blockquote>
      
      <pre class="gpt">
    <span>10</span> INPUT "Enter first number: "; <span>A</span>
    <span>20</span> INPUT "Enter second number: "; <span>B</span>
    <span>30</span> LET <span>C</span> = <span>A</span> + <span>B</span>
    <span>40</span> PRINT "The sum is: "; <span>C</span>
    <span>50</span> END
  </pre>
    </div>
    <div class="gpt_column_right">
      <blockquote class="gpt">
        Or if they were using 6502 Assembly (ML - Machine Language) for some reason, it could have been something
        hardcore like:
      </blockquote>
      <pre class="gpt">
    <span>LDA</span> num1
    <span>CLC</span>
    <span>ADC</span> num2
    <span>STA</span> result
  </pre>
    </div>
    
    <div class="full-width">
      <blockquote class="gpt">
        But honestly, unless they were a hardcore coder back then, they were writing it in BASIC, punching it in on that
        blue screen with the blinking cursor.
      </blockquote>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    This has been said by <span class="gpt">GPT</span>. I didn't even fact check it.
    It does make sense to me, do not know, maybe you readers have a different opinion...

    In <code>2001</code>, I decided to learn <strong>C/C++</strong>.
    I ordered <em>Bjarne Stroustrup’s</em> <em>"The C++ Programming Language"</em> book online, and it was a blast.
    However, at that time, I was already caught up in <code>working, working</code>, and the little time I had left after work
    wasn’t enough to learn it properly. Still, I made a promise to myself: <br>
    <span class="quote-style-border"><code>“No matter when, I will learn it.”</code></span><br>
    Fast forward to <code>autumn 2024</code>, I finally had the time to dive into the <strong>basics of C/C++</strong>.
    And just a month ago, in <code>February 2025</code>, I had this realization: <br>
    <span class="quote-style-border"><code>"Yo bro, you made it."</code></span><br>
    I mean, I don’t consider myself a <strong>C/C++ expert</strong> yet, but I’ve finally reached the day where
    I can say I’ve pursued—and achieved—a goal I set <code>more than 20 years ago</code>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Is there a moral to this<code>?</code> Is this an advice<code>?</code><br>
    Yeah, I definitely think so.<br>
    Never stop believing in yourself, Don't bury your dreams in the past-keep them alive, and sooner or later, you
    will achieve them.<br>
    It doesn’t matter whether you’re a programmer or not.<br>
    <code>It is the fulfillment of your dreams that matter the most</code>.
