    I love to code.<br>
    The first program I ever saw being written
    was a simple addition function running on a Commodore 64, and believe me, I didnâ€™t even know what I was looking at.
    The year was <code>1989</code> and I was 9 years old. To fill the gap in this memory, I asked <span class="gpt">GPT</span>, and...
  </p>
  <div class="gpt">
    <div class="gpt_column_left">
      <blockquote class="gpt">
        Back in 1989 on a Commodore 64, the most common programming language was
        <strong>Commodore BASIC 2.0</strong>, which came built into the machine.
        If someone wrote a simple addition function, it was probably in BASIC,
        looking something like this:
      </blockquote>
      
      <pre class="gpt">
    10 INPUT "Enter first number: "; A
    20 INPUT "Enter second number: "; B
    30 LET C = A + B
    40 PRINT "The sum is: "; C
    50 END
  </pre>
    </div>
    <div class="gpt_column_right">
      <blockquote class="gpt">
        Or if they were using 6502 Assembly (ML - Machine Language) for some reason, it could have been something
        hardcore like:
      </blockquote>
      <pre class="gpt">
    LDA num1
    CLC
    ADC num2
    STA result
  </pre>
    </div>
    
    <div class="full-width">
      <blockquote class="gpt">
        But honestly, unless they were a hardcore coder back then, they were writing it in BASIC, punching it in on that
        blue screen with the blinking cursor.
      </blockquote>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    This has been said by <span class="gpt">GPT</span> I didn't even fact check it.
    It does make sense to me, do not know, maybe you readers, have a different opinion, just let me know.
