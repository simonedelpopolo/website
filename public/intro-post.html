      The first program I ever saw being written
      was a simple addition function running on a Commodore 64, and believe me, I didn’t even know what I was looking at.
      The year was <code>1989</code> and I was 9 years old. To fill the gap in this memory, I asked <span
      class="gpt">GPT</span>, and...
    </p>
    <div class="gpt">
      <div class="gpt_column_left">
        <blockquote class="gpt">
          Back in 1989 on a Commodore 64, the most common programming language was
          <strong>Commodore BASIC 2.0</strong>, which came built into the machine.
          If someone wrote a simple addition function, it was probably in BASIC,
          looking something like this:
        </blockquote>

        <pre class="gpt">
  <span>10</span> INPUT "Enter first number: "; <span>A</span>
  <span>20</span> INPUT "Enter second number: "; <span>B</span>
  <span>30</span> LET <span>C</span> = <span>A</span> + <span>B</span>
  <span>40</span> PRINT "The sum is: "; <span>C</span>
  <span>50</span> END
      </pre>
      </div>
      <div class="gpt_column_right">
        <blockquote class="gpt">
          Or if they were using 6502 Assembly (ML - Machine Language) for some reason, it could have been something
          hardcore like:
        </blockquote>
        <pre class="gpt">
  <span>LDA</span> num1
  <span>CLC</span>
  <span>ADC</span> num2
  <span>STA</span> result
      </pre>
      </div>

      <div class="full-width">
        <blockquote class="gpt">
          But honestly, unless they were a hardcore coder back then, they were writing it in BASIC, punching it in on that
          blue screen with the blinking cursor.
        </blockquote>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      This is what <span class="gpt">GPT</span> told me—I didn’t even fact-check it.
      It makes sense to me, do not know, maybe you readers have a different opinion...
    </p>

      In <code>2001</code>, I decided to learn <strong>C/C++</strong>.
      I ordered <em>Bjarne Stroustrup’s</em> <em>"The C++ Programming Language"</em> book online, and it was a blast.
      However, at that time, I was already caught up in <code>working, working</code>, and the little time I had left
      after work
      wasn’t enough to learn it properly. Still, I made a promise to myself: <br>
      <span class="quote-style-border"><code>No matter when, I will learn it.</code></span><br>
      Fast forward to <code>autumn 2024</code>, I finally had the time to dive into the <strong>basics of C/C++</strong>.
      And just a month ago, in <code>February 2025</code>, I had this realization: <br>
      <span class="quote-style-border"><code>Yo bro, you made it.</code></span><br>
      I mean, I don’t consider myself a <strong>C/C++ expert</strong> yet, but I’ve finally reached the day where
      I can say I’ve pursued—and achieved—a goal I set <code>more than 20 years ago</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Is there a moral to this<code>?</code> Is this an advice<code>?</code><br>
      Yeah, I definitely think so.<br>
      Never stop believing in yourself, Don't bury your dreams in the past-keep them alive, and sooner or later, you
      will achieve them.<br>
      It doesn’t matter whether you’re a programmer or not.<br>
      <code>It is the fulfillment of your dreams that matter the most</code>.
